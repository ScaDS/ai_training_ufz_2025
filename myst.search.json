We store this data in the NGFF file format. \nAfter acquistion, two scientists, typically a PhD student and a post-doc or \ngroup leader look into the data together and decide if the dataset will be analyzed \nin detail. In case yes, we upload the data to an Omero-Server, a research data \nmanagement solution specifically developed for microscopy imaging data. Data on \nthis server is automatically backed-up by the compute center of our university. We then login \nto the Jupyter Lab server of the institute where we analyze the data. Analysis results\nare also stored in the Omero-Server next to the imaging data results belong to. The\nPython analysis code we write is stored in the institutional git-server. Also this \nserver is backed up by the compute center. When the project advances, we start writing\na manuscipt using overleaf, an online service for collaborative manuscipt editing \nbased on latex files. After every writing session, we save back the changed manuscript \nto the institutional git server. As soon as the manuscript is finished and \nsubmitted to the bioRxiv, a preprint server in the life-sciences, we also publish the \nproject-related code by marking the project on the git-server as public. We also\ntag the code with a release version. At the same time we publish the imaging data \nby submitting a copy of the dataset from the Omero-Server to zenodo.org, a \ncommunity-driven repository for research data funded by the European Union. Another \ncopy of the data, the code and the manuscript is stored on the institutional archive \nserver. This server, maintained by the compute center, garantees to archive data for \n15 years. Documents and data we published is licensed under CC-BY 4.0 license. The code \nwe publish is licensed BSD3. The entire project and all steps of the data life-cycle \nare documented in an institutional labnotebook where every user has to pay 10 Euro \nper month. Four people will work on the project.
