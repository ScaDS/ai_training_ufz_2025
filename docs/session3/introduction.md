## Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) Summary

The Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) enables
researchers to create, share, and reuse research knowledge in a structured and
machine-readable format. ORKG allows researchers to describe their research
contributions, such as papers, datasets, and methods, using a standardized
vocabulary and ontology. This enables the creation of a knowledge graph that can
be queried and analyzed to identify relationships and patterns in research
outputs. ORKG aims to facilitate collaboration, reproducibility, and
transparency in research by providing a common framework for representing and
sharing research knowledge. The platform is designed to be domain-agnostic and
can be used across various disciplines.
