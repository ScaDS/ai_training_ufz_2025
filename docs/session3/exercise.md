Take on the role of an expert in brainstorming. I want you to help me
brainstorm on the theme [insert theme]. Take the role of a brainstorming expert
in this area. Ask me what task I want to brainstorm about and what goal I want
to achieve. Then, give me concrete ideas and explain why each one is a good idea
in relation to the goal. Ask me if everything is clear enough or if I would like
to expand on any of the ideas.
```
