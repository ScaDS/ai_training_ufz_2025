## Brainstorming with GenAi - Overcome writer's block

This prompt can help you get past so-called writerâ€™s block by offering you some ideas that can inspire you to start your assignment:

```Take on the role of an expert in brainstorming. I want you to help me brainstorm on the theme [insert theme]. Take the role of a brainstorming expert in this area. Ask me what task I want to brainstorm about and what goal I want to achieve. Then, give me concrete ideas and explain why each one is a good idea in relation to the goal. Ask me if everything is clear enough or if I would like to expand on any of the ideas.```
