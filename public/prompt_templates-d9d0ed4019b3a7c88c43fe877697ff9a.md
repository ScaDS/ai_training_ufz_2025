# Prompt Templates

When asking large language models, like ChatGPT, it may make sense to ask similar questions over and over follow 
standardized formats to have comparable results. For this, prompt-templates might be helpful.
Just copy the template you like and paste it into the chat window of your favorite language model.
Make sure to replace the `<placeholders>Â´ with your actual content.
