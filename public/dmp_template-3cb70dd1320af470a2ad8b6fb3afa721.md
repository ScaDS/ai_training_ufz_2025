# A DMP Template

DMPs typically have to answer pre-defined questions and have to bin in specified formats. 
Here is an example, you can use as template for your DMP. The following list is derived from [DFG's Checklist Regarding the Handling of Research Data](https://www.dfg.de/resource/blob/174736/92691e48e89bf4ac88c8eb91b8f783b0/forschungsdaten-checkliste-en-data.pdf).

## Data description
How does your project generate new data? Is existing data reused? Which data types (in terms of data formats like image data, text data or measurement data) arise in your project and in what way are they further processed? To what extent do these arise or what is the anticipated data volume?

## Documentation and data quality
What approaches are being taken to describe the data in a comprehensible manner (such as the use of available metadata, documentation standards or ontologies)? What measures are being adopted to ensure high data quality? Are quality controls in place and if so, how do they operate? Which digital methods and tools (e.g. software) are required to use the data?

## Storage and technical archiving the project
How is the data to be stored and archived throughout the project duration? What is in place to secure sensitive data throughout the project duration (access and usage rights)?

## Legal obligations and conditions
What are the legal specifics associated with the handling of research data in your project? Do you anticipate any implications or restrictions regarding subsequent publication or accessibility? What is in place to consider aspects of use and copyright law as well as ownership issues? Are there any significant research codes or professional standards to be taken into account?

## Data exchange and long-term data accessibility 
Which data sets are especially suitable for use in other contexts? Which criteria are used to select research data to make it available for subsequent use by others? Are you planning to archive your data in a suitable infrastructure? If so, how and where? Are there any retention periods? When is the research data available for use by third parties?

## Responsibilities and resources
Who is responsible for adequate handling of the research data (description of roles and responsibilities within the project)? Which resources (costs; time or other) are required to implement adequate handling of research data within the project? Who is responsible for curating the data once the project has ended?
