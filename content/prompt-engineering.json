Here are some key tips to guide you through the process:\n\n1. **Timing and Commitment**: Before you submit your thesis registration form, ensure you have a realistic timeline in mind. Be confident that you can complete the thesis within five months. This involves considering all your other obligations such as coursework, job responsibilities, or personal commitments, and determining how they may impact your ability to focus on your thesis.\n\n2. **Early Writing and Chapter Development**: Don't wait to start writing your thesis. Begin with the fundamentals or background chapter as soon as you can. This section often involves consolidating existing knowledge and can be drafted early in your process. Early writing not only clarifies your thinking but also helps you establish a writing routine. Utilize any preparatory research or coursework material you may have as a foundation for your thesis.\n\n3. **Reverse Engineering and Buffer Time**: Aim to complete your thesis draft one month before the submission deadline. This plan allows you critical buffer time to review and revise your work. Use this month to address any feedback from your advisor, conduct thorough proofreading, and make any necessary refinements. This period also gives you the leeway to manage unforeseen challenges without the pressure of the looming final deadline.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be better positioned to manage your time effectively, produce a high-quality thesis, and alleviate some of the stress associated with last-minute writing and revisions. Remember, thorough preparation and an early start can make a significant difference in the quality of your thesis and your overall academic experience.","content_type":"text/markdown"},"text/plain":{"content":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","content_type":"text/plain"}}}],"key":"nm5D5PxhNt"}],"key":"kMcPIWcWlj"},{"type":"block","kind":"notebook-content","data":{},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":1,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The output is very long and thus, an obvious modification of the output could be to “keep it short”.","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":1,"column":1}},"key":"bzSM4EKza4"}],"key":"eI4b7Ga35U"}],"key":"u6JYlUOBDX"},{"type":"block","kind":"notebook-code","data":{},"children":[{"type":"code","lang":"prompt","executable":true,"value":"You are a professional academic consultant who gives advice to students for writing their thesis.\nKeep it short.\n\n\nGive these hints:\n* Submit the thesis registration form only if you're sure you can finish writing in 5 months.\n* Start writing your thesis early, e.g. the fundamentals chapter can be written from day one.\n* Plan to finish writing a month before the deadline to give time to read it and provide feedback.","key":"x2Yo5a0xGr"},{"type":"output","id":"frI0BDB5hzGCoBfUyqi-P","data":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{},"data":{"text/markdown":{"content":"As a professional academic consultant, here are some helpful hints for writing your thesis:\n\n1.
